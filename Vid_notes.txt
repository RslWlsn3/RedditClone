Veiw tables and data sql shell:
 - type cmreddit when given db option
 - \dt to view tables
 - SELECT * FROM <table_name>;

Add table in db via migration:
 - add entity in entities folder
 - add entity name to entities: in mikro-orm.config.ts
 - run migrations create cmd (yarn create:migration) - in package.json
